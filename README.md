# RPG Web Game

**RPG Web Game** is a web application designed in the RPG style for managing player entities. Built using Java and Spring Framework, the application supports creating, updating, and deleting game objects through a combination of REST endpoints and JSP-based user interfaces. The project is deployed via Tomcat and does not use `web.xml`, relying instead on Java-based Spring configuration.


### Description

This application allows interaction with game players via both REST API and web interface. The user can:

* create new players via a POST JSON endpoint,
* view player lists via JSP,
* filter and delete players,
* validate user data (including date of birth restrictions),
* configure and launch the application in different Spring profiles (`prod`, `test`).


### Technologies Used

* Java 17+
* Spring Framework (MVC, Dependency Injection)
* Jackson (for JSON serialization/deserialization)
* Jakarta Servlet API (without `web.xml`)
* Tomcat 10.1+
* JSP (UI rendering)
* Maven (with `war:exploded` deployment)
* JDBC & SQL


### Configuration Highlights

* **No `web.xml`** — instead uses `MyWebAppInit.java`, which extends `AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer`.

  * Initializes `AppConfig` and `WebConfig` as Java configuration classes.
  * Launches with custom profile: `-Dspring.profiles.active=prod`

* **Tomcat Integration in IntelliJ IDEA:**

  * Port: 8080
  * Context: `/rpg-1.0-SNAPSHOT`
  * Deployment: `war exploded`


### REST API

* Base path: `/rest/players`
* Main controller: `PlayerController`

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/rest/players")
public class PlayerController { ... }
```

* JSON POST request creates a `Player` using DTO `PlayerInfo`


### Validation Rules

The `createPlayer()` method restricts birth year to 2000–3000:

```java
if (year < 2000 || year > 3000) {
  return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)...
}
```

* Important: Correct path (`/resources/`) is necessary for JSP UI to function


### Known Issues & Fixes

* `400 Bad Request` if birthday is missing or out of valid range
* POST request fails unless correct JSON with required fields is sent:

```json
{
  "name": "Player1",
  "title": "Warrior",
  "race": "HUMAN",
  "profession": "WARRIOR",
  "birthday": 1234567890000,
  "experience": 1000
}
```


### How to Run

1. Configure Tomcat 10.1.11+ in IntelliJ IDEA

   * VM Option: `-Dspring.profiles.active=prod`
   * Artifact: `rpg:war exploded`

2. Launch Tomcat config

3. Open browser: [http://localhost:8080/rpg-1.0-SNAPSHOT/](http://localhost:8080/rpg-1.0-SNAPSHOT/)


### Database Initialization

In the root directory, you will find a file named `init.sql` that initializes the main production database (`rpg`) and populates it with default player data.

You must run this script to create:

* Database: `rpg`
* Table: `player`
* 40+ sample entries (across races and professions)

⚙️ Default JDBC configuration (can be customized in your `@Configuration` class):

```java
@Profile("prod")
@Bean
public DataSource dataSource() {
    DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
    dataSource.setDriverClassName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
    dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/rpg");
    dataSource.setUsername("spring");
    dataSource.setPassword("spring123");
    return dataSource;
}
```

You can modify the credentials and JDBC URL to match your local MySQL configuration.

🧪 For testing purposes, a separate `TestSQL.sql` file is located in `src/test/resources/`. This script initializes the `test` database and may be used independently from the production `init.sql`.


### Planned Improvements

* Move hardcoded config to `.properties` or `.yaml`
* Add Swagger UI for REST API documentation
* Enhance DTO validation via annotations
* Add flexible date handling and error messaging


This project helped reinforce knowledge of Java EE architecture, Spring MVC configuration, JSP handling, and RESTful endpoint integration. It also included practice with raw JDBC, SQL scripting, profile-based configuration, and full-stack deployment.
